## SLX tool for students

The SLX tool (courtesy of James O. Henriksen) is restricted to student use. Unfortunately, the full version of SLX is not available any longer.

The tool is installed by downloading and extracting the [zip archive](https://github.com/PrinzAndreas/ModellingProgramming/blob/main/SLXToolStudents/SLX.zip).
You can then start the SLX tool by running the <code>sse.exe</code> file in the SLX folder.

To run the SLX Room model, 
open the file [HeatingModel.slx](https://github.com/PrinzAndreas/ModellingProgramming/blob/main/ModelDescriptions/RoomModelSLX/HeatingModel.slx) in the SLX tool, 
compile it (F6) and then run it (F5).
