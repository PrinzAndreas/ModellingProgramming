## SLX tool for students

The SLX tool is restricted to student use and courtesy of James O. Henriksen.

It is installed by extracting the zip archive.

You can then start the SLX tool by running the <code>sse.exe</code> file in the SLX folder.

To run the heating model, open the file HeatingModel.slx, compile it (F6) and then run it (F5).
